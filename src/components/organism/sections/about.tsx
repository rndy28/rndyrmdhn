                Hello There ðŸ‘‹, My name is Rendy Farhan Ramadhan and  I&apos;m a student from Jakarta, Indonesia. I&apos;m a passionate web developer who loves to create things.
                Although in the first semester of my high school life i was not so interested in programming, because when i go into that high school its just because its free of charge.
                <br />
                <br />
                Then after my first semester is done, I think about my future more seriously and i started to learn programming. Although at first i struggled with it, but after a while i started to understand it.
                Fast forward to today i&apos;m still learning new things and I&apos;m still trying to learn more about programming.
                <br />
                <br />
                Here are some of programming languages(and frameworks) that i&apos;ve been working with recently:
